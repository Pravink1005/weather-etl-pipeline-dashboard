# 🌦️ Weather ETL Pipeline with Interactive Dashboard

### Tamil Nadu Weather Analytics (End-to-End Data Engineering Project)

---

## 🚀 Overview

This project is a **production-style end-to-end ETL pipeline** that collects real-time weather data, processes it, stores historical records, and presents insights through an interactive dashboard.

It simulates a real-world data engineering system with automation, logging, and analytics—focused on **Tamil Nadu city-level weather monitoring**.

## 🔄 ETL Pipeline

### 1️⃣ Extract

* Fetches real-time weather data via API
* Supports multiple Tamil Nadu cities

### 2️⃣ Transform

* Cleans and structures raw JSON data
* Extracted fields:

  * City
  * Temperature 🌡️
  * Humidity 💧
  * Pressure 🌍
  * Wind Speed 🌬️
  * Weather Description ☁️

### 3️⃣ Load

* Stores processed data into SQLite
* Maintains **historical time-series records**

---

## ⏰ Automation (Scheduler)

* Runs automatically at defined intervals (default: 1 hour)
* Can be configured for faster testing (e.g., 1 minute)
* Ensures continuous and hands-free data ingestion

---

## 📊 Dashboard Features

### 🌍 City Selection

* Select and explore any tracked city

### 📈 Time-Series Analytics

* Temperature trends
* Humidity trends
* Pressure trends
* Wind speed trends

### 📋 Data Exploration

* View raw historical records in tabular format

---

## 🧾 Logging & Monitoring

All ETL activities are tracked in:

```
data/etl_logs.log
```

### Logs include:

* Job execution timestamps
* Success/failure status
* Error tracking
* Data insertion details

---

## 🏙️ Supported Cities

* Chennai
* Coimbatore
* Madurai
* Trichy
* Salem
* Tirunelveli
